        <p>The Township Blue Sox are looking for coaches to join us for our upcoming 2024-2025 season. The season start with our fall ball program in Sept. &amp; Oct. We then move into our off season winter training that runs for 6-7 weeks in Nov. &amp; Dec. Tryouts will start early in the new year with our teams being chosen in early Feb.</p>
        
        
        <br>
        <p>We are offering teams in the following divisions for 2025:</p>
        <ol>
            <p>13U AAA</p>
            <p>15U AA</p>
            <p>15U AAA</p>
            <p>18U AAA</p>
        </ol>
        <br>
        <p>Up to this point stability at the township level has been a challenge. We strive to change that going forward. We are looking to name our head coaches for our 2025 teams in Aug. so that they can begin the development process in the fall and work with players through the off season. When we pick our teams in February the coaches will have already worked with their players for months building clear expectations and a development path. </p>
        
        
        <br>
        <p> If you are interested in coaching with our Township Blue Sox teams please go to the contact section. Please have your application in by July 25th to be considered. Coach selections will be announced on Aug. 2nd.</p>
